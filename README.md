# Digits-Recognition

The techniques used in the project is EM algorithm under assumptions of mixture Gaussian. When two specific digits are chosen, basically we assume these two digits' pictures originate from `M` different Gaussian distributions separately (`2M` Gaussians in all), and use training set by means of EM to determine the mean and variance of every normal distribution, along with the probability of allocating a new picture into these distributions. Then we classify pictures of both digits in test set based on MLE. 

This project contains four files.

digits.RData is the data source, it has two datasets, 'training.data' and  'test.data'. `training.data` is a large array with dimension 10 (number of digits: 0 ~ 9) * 1000 (number of pictures of each digit) * 20 * 20 (dimensionality of each digit, boolean form). `test.data` is 10 * 500 * 20 * 20.

Rcode.R includes all main functions that have been used in the project;

Final Project.rmd includes the formula derivation of EM, description of how EM works and the final output using the functions created in Rcode.R

Final_Project.pdf is the pdf file generated by Final Project.rmd using RMarkdown
